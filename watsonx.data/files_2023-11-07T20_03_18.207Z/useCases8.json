		"Andy:\nExcellent and well maintained. Highly organized and efficient. Handles the traffic so well even at this time of the year when there is a huge influx of international students coming to start their Universities in Vancouver. Plenty of taxi services available just outside the airport.  Extremely helpful staff.",
		"Chris Martin:\nMore than 50% of the flights into and out of the YVR are delayed, security staff aka curbside operations specifically the ones who deal with the parking matters are rude, the bathrooms are most of the time dirty.",
        "Joey:\nA very comfortable airport to wait for one's flight. Comfy seats and various seating arrangements around artistic energies including a Bill Reid sculpture and other water features and sculptures. There are food stores and retail stores. It feels almost like a shopping mall rather than an airport which is very nice. Probably could do with more charging stations near seating areas."

					"input": "The design of the airport is nice, with natural light falling in making it very bright and cosy. Shops and cafes are very well organized. Water fountains are outside bathrooms, very easy to access. Bathrooms are clean and there's one compartment that is big enough for a trolley to get in. Very convenient. \nI deducted one star for the rude behaviors that I encountered at the security check. The staff's instructions were unclear, and she was not helpful at all. I think one shouldn't expect friendly behaviors at security checks in North America, as my past travel experiences told.",

This AAC is her voice how dare they do that.\nWe had a late evening flight on 8/9/23. My child cried and cried she could not understand why they would take her voice away.\nThe supervisor said to me that it's not attached to her so it has to go through the screening, then after it went through they kept it from her while they patted her down, she had no way of telling them if they were hurting her or embarrassingly her.\nMy advice to all parents or persons who use a speech device DO NOT FLY TO CANADA, they have the most horrible people at the TSA.\nWe will never be able to see our elderly family who resides in Canada.\nSomeone needs to fix this now!!!",

I walked around a long time looking for something to eat for breakfast and finally decided to wait in a really long line for well over 20 minutes at a Tim Horton’s. I got a muffin and juice. I spoke to several other people in the airport that shared my opinion of not enough breakfast cafes. We were all frustrated.",

Impossible to find a beer or wine. If you like fast food and coffee, you're in luck with 4 locations open in the food court. Staff was pleasant but all airline counters were empty of staff. If it wasn't for the fact of being the only gateway to the east in Canada, I'd definitely avoid it.",
