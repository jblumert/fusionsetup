				"detailed": "Soil and Groundwater\n\nSoil refers to unconsolidated naturally occurring mineral particles and other materials resulting\nfrom the breakdown of rock or organic matter by physical, chemical or biological processes that\nare smaller than 2 millimetres in size or that pass the US #10 sieve, as per the definition of soil\nin O. Reg. 406/19. Groundwater refers to below-ground water conditions, including the flow of\nwater from the surface into the groundwater, and the presence or absence of drinking water\nwells.\n\nMethodology\n\nA review of available information was conducted to establish existing conditions in the Study\nArea. The following aspects were examined:\n- Geological setting, including physiography and topography, surficial geology, quaternary\ngeology, and bedrock geology\n- Hydrogeological setting, including regional groundwater flow\n-Groundwater resources, including source water protection features and MECP water\nwell records\n-The potential for soil and groundwater contamination\n\nA background review of available desktop information to characterize the existing soil and\ngroundwater conditions used the following sources:\n- MECP open data catalogue resources, including the Water Well Records database and\nSource Water Protection Information Atlas\n- TRCA reports and plans, including the Source Water Protection Conceptual\nUnderstanding of the Water Budget (Puopolo and Usher 2007), Don River Watershed\nPlan: Geology and Groundwater Resources (2009), and Toronto and Region Source\nProtection Area, Approved Updated Assessment Report (2015)\n- Ontario Geological Survey resources, including the Physiography of Southern Ontario,\nThird Edition (Chapman and Putnam 1984), Paleozoic Geology of Southern Ontario\n(Armstrong, D.K. and Dodge, J.E.P. 2007), and Metropolitan Toronto Bedrock Contours\n(Rogers et al. 1961)\n- Ontario Line Project, Limited Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Report, prepared\nAECOM, July 2020 (AECOM 2020c)\n\nTo assess soil and groundwater baseline quality and future monitoring, the Project will use\nOntario's Soil, Groundwater and Sediment Standards for Use under Part XV.1 of the\nEnvironmental Protection Act.\n\n4.4.2\n\nOntario Line West\n\nGeological Setting\nPhysiography and Topography\nThe Project Footprint is situated in the Iroquois Plain physiographic region, as mapped by\nChapman and Putnam (1984), as shown on Figure 4-8. The Iroquois Plain occurs as a lowland\nbordering the western component of Lake Ontario, extending from the Niagara River to the\nTrent River over a distance of approximately 305 kilometres. The Iroquois Plain represents the\nhistoric bottom of glacial Lake Iroquois and stands in contrast to the shoreline areas of the\nformer glacial lake situated further inland (Chapman and Putnam 1984). Across its length, the\nwidth of the Iroquois plain varies from only a few hundred metres up to about 13 kilometres. In\nthe vicinity of the City of Toronto, the Iroquois Plain is approximately 3 kilometres wide and is\ncut into previously deposited clay and till, being partly floored with glaciolacustrine sand\ndeposits.\n\nThe ground surface topography is shown on Figure 4-9. Elevations range from approximately\n80 to 90 metres above sea level. The topography is highly affected by the extensive local\ndevelopment and is generally undulating in nature, with a general downward slope in the\ndirection of Lake Ontario.\n\nSurficial Geology\nThe surficial geology is shown on Figure 4-10. The surficial geology is identified as Till Deposits\n(undifferentiated older tills, which may include stratified deposits).\n\nQuaternary Geology\nThe Quaternary geology is shown on Figure 4-11. The Quaternary geology indicates that the\nprimary surficial deposits are Glaciolacustrine Deposits (sand, gravelly sand, and gravel) and till\nwith sandy silt to silt matrix.\n\nBedrock Geology\nBedrock geology is shown on Figure 4-12. Based on the Ontario Geological Survey regional\nmapping, the uppermost bedrock is composed of shale and limestone of the Georgian Bay\nFormation from the Upper Ordovician period (Armstrong, D.K. and Dodge, J.E.P. 2007). The\nMetropolitan Toronto Bedrock Contours map (Rogers et al. 1961) indicates the surface bedrock\nelevation ranges from approximately 70 to 84 metres above sea level.\n\nHydrogeological Setting\nHydrogeology\nWhere present, surficial aquifer units in the Project Footprint are typically comprised of coarsetextured unconsolidated (overburden) sand and gravelly sediments. Based on the Overburden\nThickness map (Toronto and Region Source Protection Area 2015) and a typical north-south\ncross-section along Yonge Street provided by TRCA as part of the Conceptual Understanding\nWater Budget Report (Puopolo, J. and Usher, S. 2007), the overburden thickness in the Project\nFootprint is less than approximately 20 metres, with thinner overburden deposits observed in\nthe southern portion of the Project Footprint.\nA review of the MECP water well record database indicates that the overburden geological\nmaterials consist of primarily clayey silt, sand, silty clay, and sand silt, and silty sand in localized\nareas. Bedrock was encountered at depths ranging from approximately 4.2 to 9.1 metres below\nground surface.\nThe Toronto and Region Source Protection Area (2015) identified two Hydrostratigraphic Units\nin the Project Footprint: Sunnybrook aquitard and Scarborough Aquifer Complex. The Project\nFootprint is at the approximate boundary of the mapped extent of the Thorncliffe Aquifer. It is\nunlikely that this unit exhibits significant thickness, if it is present at all in the Project Footprint.\n\n\nRegional Groundwater Flow\nIn general, the dynamics of shallow groundwater flow within overburden deposits are related to\nthe surface topography with flow directed to topographic lows, wetlands, and surface\nwatercourses. Deeper aquifer systems, including bedrock aquifer(s), tend to be more uniform\nand are less influenced by topographic variations. Groundwater flow in shallow aquifer(s) is\nprimarily horizontal with a minor vertical component to deeper units or discharge zones (flow\nrate depends on the hydraulic conductivity and gradient of the unit). Flow within aquitard units\ntends to be primarily downward towards deeper units. Flow direction changes depending on\nproximity to surface watercourses/water bodies and subsurface geology.\nThe surficial/shallow groundwater system in the Project Footprint is influenced by surface\ntopography and likely flows to the south towards Lake Ontario.\n\nGroundwater Resources\nSource Water Protection\nThe Project Footprint is in the Toronto and Region Source Protection Area. The presence of\nsource water areas/features is described below and shown on Figure 4-13. A summary of\nsource water protection details is included in Table 4-2 below.\n\nMECP Water Well Records\nAn inventory of local private water wells (i.e., domestic, commercial, industrial, etc.) within a\n500-metre buffer around the Project Footprint was prepared by searching the MECP Water\nWells Information System database. Results are shown on Figure 4-14, along with the primary\nuse of each well. A total of 1125 water well records were found. No domestic water supply wells\nwere found in the background data.\nAs shown in Table 4-3, available well records indicate that 72% of known groundwater use is for\nmonitoring and test hole purposes. Approximately 6% of the MECP water well records indicate\nthat the well is not used, accounting for decommissioning records and dry wells Approximately\n22% of the water well records did not specify the well use and therefore are classified as\n‘Unknown’.\n\nMECP Summary\nA search of the MECP Permit to Take Water database returned 15 results in the 500-metre\nbuffer around the Project Footprint. Fourteen of these results were expired and one is an active\nrecord related to construction dewatering. A search of the MECP Environmental Activity and\nSector Registry database returned 26 results, of which 20 were identified for construction\ndewatering purposes.\n\nWater Level Data\nTwenty-four MECP water well records reported a static water level. These reported water levels\nrepresent either the water table position or the potentiometric surface depending on whether a\ngiven well is installed in an unconfined or confined aquifer. MECP water well records do not\nprovide sufficient information to confirm aquifer conditions. The static water level was reported\non the identified well records ranged between 0.3 and 12.8 metres below ground surface.\n\n\n\nSoil and Groundwater Contamination\nThe Project Footprint is situated in a high-density urban environment with significant commercial\nand industrial history, which suggests a greater possibility of encountering soil and groundwater\ncontamination during construction of the Project.\nAccording to the Limited Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (AECOM 2020c), the Project\nFootprint comprises a mix of residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional land uses from\n1894 to the present day. The Project Footprint also includes the current Canadian National\nRailway and associated yards that date back to at least 1894, that were formerly named the\nGrand Trunk Railway G.W. Division.\nDuring the Limited Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (AECOM 2020c), over 1,161\nproperties were evaluated in a study area roughly equivalent to the Ontario Line West Project\nFootprint, with approximately 25% of properties given a high-risk potential for soil and ground\nwater contamination, and approximately 25% were designated as medium risk properties.\nThe remaining properties were deemed to be low-risk or have a minimal risk rating.\nA high-risk rating was given to properties that were considered enhanced investigation\nproperties as defined by O. Reg. 153/04, i.e., property that is used, or has ever been used, in\nwhole or in part for an industrial use or the following commercial uses: automotive garage, a\nbulk liquid dispensing facility, including a gasoline outlet, or for the operation of dry-cleaning\nequipment. Other properties that were considered high risk included if one or a combination of\nthe following occurred: on-site spills, monitoring wells observed, the presence of underground\nstorage tanks, above ground storage tanks, railways, and landfills.\nA medium risk rating was given to properties that may possess high risk activities but do not\nshow evidence of on-going environmental concern such as roadways, parking lots, driveways,\nprivate lane ways and highways. These types of properties were considered to have a medium\nrisk rating due to the moderate probability of contamination occurring as a result of their\nhistorical or current land use. Additionally, a property maybe ranked as medium risk if there\nwere light manufacturing activities on site or the history of a commercial property was\nindeterminate.\nA low-risk rating was given to properties if in the past or present it may possess potentially\ncontaminating materials if released into the environment but otherwise has no indication that\ncontaminating activities have existed or are on-going. These properties are typically occupied by\na commercial business such as a restaurant, bar, clothing store etc. If the current land use of\nthe property is residential but the previous land use was commercial, then the property was\nconsidered low risk.\nA minimal risk rating was given to properties that are currently and historically residential,\nparkland or undeveloped and are considered to have a minimal/negligible environmental risk.\nIn addition, during the Limited Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (AECOM 2020c) data\nsearch, a total of 57 Records of Site Condition (RSC) and five Certificates of Property Use\n(CPU) were identified. A RSC is registered for sites that were previously impacted with contamination or have been risk assessed so that contamination left on-site has been mitigated\nagainst for human and ecological health risk effects. At the properties where an RSC has been\ncompleted using a Risk Assessment, a CPU will be held on land title that will outline engineered\nrisk mitigation measures and soil management requirements that apply to the property.\n\nQuestion: ",

				"detailed": "4.6\n\nArchaeological Resources\n\nArchaeological resources are physical remnants recovered from the ground surface or below its\nsurface which show evidence of past human activity. If present, these resources provide\ninformation on past human use of, and interaction with, the physical environment in the area.\nArchaeological resources may be from the earliest times of human occupation to the more\nrecent past (e.g., 100 years before present).\n\n4.6.1\n\nMethodology\n\nStantec conducted a Stage 1 Archaeological Assessment in 2022 to consolidate and update\nprevious archaeological investigations of the Project (see Appendix A3). \n\nAECOM had previously produced three Stage 1 archaeological assessment reports for the Project in 2020,\ndividing the Project into west (AECOM 2020e), south (AECOM 2020f), and north (AECOM\n2020g) segments. In 2021, based upon additional information, AECOM then updated and\nmodified their archaeological potential determinations and recommendations for the south\nsegment in an Addendum\" report (AECOM 2021a) which superseded the previous south\nsegment report. \n\nThe findings of the Stage 1 Archaeological Assessment Environmental Conditions Reports (2020h) were reviewed by AECOM and updated as appropriate to reflect the current\nProject understanding, scope, and footprint. The objectives of this assessment were to:\n- provide information about the study area’s geography, history, previous archaeological\nfieldwork, and current land conditions\n- evaluate the study area’s archaeological potential which will support recommendations\nfor further archaeological assessment for all or parts of the property\n- recommend appropriate strategies for further archaeological assessment, if required\n\nThe Stage 1 Archaeological Assessment was completed in compliance with the provincial\nstandards and guidelines set out in the MHSTCI’s 2011 Standards and Guidelines for\nConsultant Archaeologists (Government of Ontario 2011). Since the Stage 1 Archaeological\nAssessment produced by Stantec will be reviewed by the MHSTCI, the archaeological potential\nas illustrated in Figures 15.1 to 15.19 in Appendix A3 is subject to revision.\nThe existing conditions for the Project were identified by employing the following research\nstrategies:\n- Review of relevant archaeological, historic, and environmental literature pertaining to the\nstudy area\n- Review of land use history, including pertinent historic maps\n- Examination of the Ontario Archaeological Sites Database to determine the presence of\nregistered archaeological sites in and around the study area\n- Review of the City of Toronto archaeological management plan to identify predetermined\nareas of archaeological potential\n- Property inspection of the study area\n\n\nArchaeological potential was determined based on the review of previous archaeological\nassessment recommendations, the identification of features indicating archaeological potential\nin or in proximity to the study area, as defined by the MHSTCI (Government of Ontario 2011:\nSection 1.3.1), the City of Toronto’s mapping of archaeological potential under the Master Plan\nof Archaeological Resources for the City of Toronto, as well as the presence or absence of\non-site conditions which indicate that archaeological potential has been removed (e.g. deep and\nextensive prior disturbance).\nFurther details regarding archaeological resources can be found in Appendix A3.\n\n4.6.2\n\nOntario Line West\n\nBased on the applied criteria described in the methodology section and previous assessments\nconducted on the area, it was determined that there is potential for the recovery of pre-and and\npost-contact Indigenous and 19th century Euro-Canadian archaeological resources.\nApproximately 0.481 hectares of the OLW Study Area was identified as possessing\narchaeological potential for which Stage 2 archaeological assessment is recommended (see\nFigure 4-32-1 to Figure 4-32-4).\nApproximately 1.07 hectares of the OLW Study Area are considered to possess low to no\narchaeological potential due to deep and extensive land alterations that have severely damaged\nthe integrity of any archaeological resources. In addition, approximately 6.085 hectares of the\nOLW Study Area require tunneling through bedrock and, therefore, there will be no impact to\nsoils containing archaeological resources; no further archaeological assessment is required for\nthose segments. The remainder of the OLW Study Area has been previously assessed.\n\n4.6.3\n\nOntario Line South\n\nBased on the applied criteria described in the methodology section and previous assessments\nconducted on the area, it was determined that there is potential for the recovery of pre-and and\npost-contact Indigenous and 19th century Euro-Canadian archaeological resources.\nApproximately 3.658 hectares of the OLS Study Area was identified as possessing\narchaeological potential for which Stage 2 archaeological assessment is recommended (see\nFigure 4-32-4 to Figure 4-32-13).\nApproximately 1.64 hectares of the OLS Study Area are considered to possess low to no\narchaeological potential due to deep and extensive land alterations that have severely damaged\nthe integrity of any archaeological resources. In addition, approximately 7.869 hectares of the\nOLS Study Area require tunneling through bedrock and, therefore, there will be no impact to\nsoils containing archaeological resources; no further archaeological assessment is required for\nthose segments. The remainder of the OLS Study Area has been previously assessed.\n\n\nAdditionally, the desktop review identified two registered archaeological sites located in the OLS\nStudy Area with outstanding cultural heritage value or interest. These are Parliament site, and\nthe Lime Kiln works site. In accordance with previous assessments (ASI 2012; Archeoworks\n2009), Stage 4 mitigation is recommended for these sites.\n\n4.6.4\n\nOntario Line North\n\nBased on the applied criteria described in the methodology section and previous assessments\nconducted on the area, it was determined that there is potential for the recovery of pre-and and\npost-contact Indigenous and 19th century Euro-Canadian archaeological resources.\nApproximately 27.256 hectares of the OLN Study Area was identified as possessing\narchaeological potential for which Stage 2 archaeological assessment is recommended (see\nFigure 4-32-13 to Figure 4-32-19).\nApproximately 2.621 hectares of the OLN Study Area are considered to possess low to no\narchaeological potential due to deep and extensive land alterations that have severely damaged\nthe integrity of any archaeological resources, or due to being steeply sloped. In addition,\napproximately 3.343 hectares of the OLN Study Area require tunneling through bedrock and,\ntherefore, there will be no impact to soils containing archaeological resources; no further\narchaeological assessment is required for those segments. The remainder of the OLN Study\nArea has been previously assessed.\n\n4.8\n\nAir Quality\n\nAir quality refers to the presence or absence of substances in the outdoor air that, if present in\nlarge enough quantities, could cause harm to humans or other flora and fauna in the area being\nstudied. These include substances in gaseous or solid (particulate) form.\n\n4.8.1\n\nMethodology\n\nAn Air Quality Impact Assessment Report was prepared by Stantec in 2022 (see Appendix A5).\nThe findings of the Air Quality Assessment Environmental Conditions Report (AECOM 2020j),\ncompleted in support of the Environmental Conditions Report, were reviewed and updated as\nappropriate to reflect the current Project understanding, scope, and footprint.\nThe objectives of this assessment were to:\n-establish the study area\n\n-identify the air contaminants of interest, and the regulatory framework\n\n-assess and establish existing conditions\n\n-identify air emissions sources\n\n-assess potential impacts\n\n-provide recommendations for mitigation measures and monitoring activities\n\nWhere applicable, guidance from the MTO Environmental Guide for Assessing and Mitigating\nthe Air Quality Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Provincial Transportation Projects\n(MTO 2020) were followed.\nFurther details regarding air quality can be found in Appendix A5.\n\n3. A privately-owned public space is a specific type of open space which the public is welcome to enjoy\nbut remains privately owned. The City often negotiates with private developers to include these as part\nof the development application and review process, to provide open space within Toronto’s dense\nurban landscape (City of Toronto 2020c).\nApril 2022 | 228\n\n\fEnvironmental Impact Assessment Report\n\n4.8.2\n\nOntario Line West\n\nExisting conditions in the Study Area were established through a review of background\ninformation, and determining air contaminants of interest, air emission sources, background\nambient air quality concentrations, receptors, land use, and meteorological conditions.\nThe OLW Study Area consists of a mix of land uses including Employment Industrial,\nResidential, Commercial Residential, Open Space, and Utility and Transportation zones.\nMeteorological conditions from the Toronto City Centre station (Station ID 71265) are\nrepresentative of the OWL Study Area. The most frequent single wind direction measured at the\nToronto City Centre station is from the east-northeast but with winds blowing most frequently\nfrom westerly directions (northwest to southwest) (AECOM 2020j).\nActivities that generate air contaminants of interest in the OLW, OLN, and OLS sections are\nsimilar. Air contaminants of interest in the OLW Study Area are associated with road traffic\nemissions from buses and passenger vehicles, emissions from diesel locomotives travelling\nalong the rail corridors, and industrial emissions.\nBackground ambient air quality concentrations were assessed using data from the nearby\nNational Air Pollution Surveillance Network or MECP stations (ECCC 2020 and AECOM 2020j).\nStations were selected near the Study Area to be representative of ambient concentrations in\nthe three sections (OLW, OLS and OLN). Background levels for contaminants of interest in the\nOLW Study Area are well below their applicable objectives, with the noted exception of benzene\nand benzo(a)pyrene. The annual background concentration of benzene exceeds the criteria by\n36%. Background concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene for both 24-hour and annual averaging\nperiods are more than twice and six times the criteria, respectively. Exceedances are common\nin southern Ontario (including rural areas), and they are not unique to the study area. Based on\nthe Air Quality in Ontario 2017 Report (MECP 2019a), the mean annual benzene concentrations\nmeasured at the seven MECP monitoring stations ranged from 0.34 µg/m3 to 0.60 µg/m3, and\nthey exceeded the annual ambient air quality criteria of 0.45 µg/m3 at two of the seven\nmonitoring stations. However, the trend in the ambient benzene concentration in Ontario over\nthe ten-year period, from 2008 to 2017, is downward, where measured concentrations have\ndecreased 24% during that time period (MECP 2019a).\nCurrent and potential future sensitive (residential dwellings) and critical receptors (including\nschools, childcare centres, and institutional buildings) were identified in the OLW Study Area\n(see Figure 4-37 and Figure 4-38).\n\n4.8.3\n\nOntario Line South\n\nLand uses in the OLS Study Area include commercial, residential, residential, open space,\nemployment industrial, residential, and utility and transportation zones.\n\nApril 2022 | 229\n\n\fEnvironmental Impact Assessment Report\n\nWeather conditions at the Toronto Pearson International Airport station (Station ID 61587) are\nreasonably representative of the OLS Study Area. The predominant wind directions measured\nat the Toronto Pearson International Airport are from the north-northwest and west, with lower\nwindspeeds occurring for winds predominantly blowing from the southwest (AECOM 2020j).\nThe activities that generate air contaminants of interest, and the background ambient air quality\nconcentrations for OLW, OLS and OLN sections, are similar and are presented in Section\n4.8.2.\nCurrent and potential future sensitive (residential dwellings) and critical receptors (including\nschools, hospitals, childcare centres, and institutional buildings) were identified in the OLS\nStudy Area (see Figure 4-37 and Figure 4-38).\n\n4.8.4\n\nOntario Line North\n\nThe OLN Study Area contains a mix of residential, commercial residential, open space,\ninstitutional, residential apartment, employment industrial, and utility and transportation zones.\nWeather conditions at the Toronto Pearson International Airport station (Station ID 61587) are\nrepresentative of the OLN Study Area. The predominant wind directions measured at the\nToronto Pearson International Airport are from the north-northwest and west, with lower\nwindspeeds occurring for winds predominantly blowing from the southwest (AECOM 2020j).\nThe activities that generate air contaminants of interest, and the background ambient air quality\nconcentrations for OLW, OLS and OLN sections, are similar and are presented in Section\n4.8.2.\nCurrent and potential future sensitive (residential dwellings) and critical receptors (including\nschools, retirement homes, and childcare centres) were identified in the OLN Study Area (see\nFigure 4-37 and Figure 4-38).\n\nQuestion: ",
