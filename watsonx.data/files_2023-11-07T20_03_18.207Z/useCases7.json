The app is pretty much useless now so there was no point in keeping it on my phone.",
		"Use to enjoy the cardlock map but now the update sucks , please go back to map view of all cardlocks instead of list.",
        "I love this app. I check the coupons every time I go to the grocery store to see what I might be able to save on. I especially love that I can input my Co-op number and easily access it if I ever forget it. You can also add numbers for multiple Co-ops which is a huge bonus for when I'm travelling. Plus, if you're like me and have a bunch of gift cards with miscellaneous dollars left on them - you can check your balance before you go to the store. Total win!"
