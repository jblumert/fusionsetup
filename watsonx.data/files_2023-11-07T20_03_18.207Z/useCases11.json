        "detailed": "<s>[INST] <<SYS>> You are a helpful and honest operations assistant.\nYou are given the following document, delimited by triple backticks, extracted from our company's documentation. You will answer to our employee's Instruction by using the content of the provided document:\n\nDocument: ```10.0 Operational Procedures\n10.1 Network Resource Availability Information\nFor any Network Resources or generation resources which are under the control of a Transmission Customer and available for dispatch by the NLSO, the Transmission Customer (or its Designated Agent) shall be responsible for promptly informing the NLSO of any operational conditions which adversely affect the ability of such resource to produce and deliver Energy consistent with the normal and operating ratings for such resource, including:\ni. Forced or unforced outages of the resource;\nii. Initiation of maintenance which requires restricted operation of the resource;\niii. Changes in the minimum loading level of the resource;\niv. Changes in the normal operating range of the unit;\nv. Changes in the ramp rate limits of the unit; or\nvi. Any other condition which is reasonably expected, consistent with Good Utility Practice, to adversely affect the availability of such resource to produce and deliver Energy in response to a dispatch instruction from the NLSO.\n10.2 NL Point\nFor purposes of the efficient dispatch of generating units for the Reliable operation of the NL Control Area to meet NL Native Load and other accepted Transmission Service schedules, the NLSO shall maintain and utilize a centralized scheduling point (NL Point) which may be used by a Transmission Customer as either a Point of Receipt or Point of Delivery for use in the reservation of Point-to-Point Transmission Service. \n\n11.0 Transmission Service Reservations and Schedules\nRequests to reserve Point-to-Point Transmission Service must be submitted on OASIS. The reservation priorities for Transmission Service over the NL Transmission System are as follows:\ni. Existing Transmission Customers (with a term of agreement of one year or more), have the right to continue to take Transmission Service from the NLSO when the Transmission Service Agreement expires, rolls over or is renewed;\nii. Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service shall have equal reservation priority with Network Integration Transmission Service;\niii. Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service and Network Integration Transmission Service shall have a reservation priority over Conditional Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service and Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service;\niv. Long-Term Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service shall be available on a first-come, first-served basis. The priority assigned to a request for Short-Term Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service shall be given to the requested service (e.g., monthly, weekly, daily) with the longest duration. An existing Transmission Customer holding a reservation for Short-Term Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service shall have the right of first refusal to match any longer term request before being pre-empted. A longer\nterm competing request for Short-term Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service will be granted if the existing Transmission Customer does not agree to match the competing request within 24 hours (or earlier if necessary to comply with scheduling deadlines) for Short-Term Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service after notification by the NLSO. Among reservations with the same duration priority will be given to the reservation by the date and time of the reservation;\nv. Conditional Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service shall have a reservation priority over Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service.\nvi. Network Integration Transmission Service from secondary resources other than designated Network Resources will have a higher priority than any Non-Firm Point-toPoint Transmission Service;\nvii. Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service shall be available from ATC, as posted by the NLSO on the NLSO OASIS, in excess of that scheduled by Transmission Customers holding reservations for Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service, Network Integration Transmission Service, or Conditional Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service. Except as noted in vii, the priority assigned to a request for Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service shall be given to the requested service (e.g., monthly, daily, hourly) with the longest duration. An existing Transmission Customer holding a reservation for Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service shall have the right of first refusal to match any longer term request before being pre-empted. A longer term competing request for Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service will be granted if the existing Transmission Customer does not agree to match the competing request: (a) immediately for hourly Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service after notification by Transmission Provider; and (b) within 24 hours (or earlier if necessary to comply with scheduling deadlines) for Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service other than hourly transactions after notification by the NLSO. Among reservations with the same duration priority will be given to the reservation by the date and time of the reservation; and\nviii. Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service over secondary point(s) of receipt and point(s) of delivery will have the lowest reservation priority, without regard to the duration of such reservation.\nAll schedules to deliver Capacity and Energy shall be in accordance with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) electronic tagging (e-Tag) requirements.\nHour-to-hour schedules of any Capacity and Energy that is to be delivered must be stated in increments of 1 MW per hour. Transmission Customers with multiple requests to reserve Pointto-Point Transmission Service at a Point of Receipt, each of which is under 1 MW per hour, may consolidate their requests for Transmission Service at a common Point of Receipt into units of 1 MW per hour for scheduling and billing purposes.\nAn agent to the Transmission Customer that has been designated and approved by the NLSO to exercise third-party scheduling rights shall have the right to submit requests for the scheduling of Point-to-Point Transmission Service. \n\n11.1 Reservation of Point-to-Point Transmission Service\nRequests to reserve Point-to-Point Transmission Service shall be submitted on OASIS as follows:\ni. For monthly service, no earlier than sixty (60) calendar days before service is to\ncommence;\nii. For weekly service, no earlier than fourteen (14) calendar days before service is to\ncommence;\niii. For daily service, no earlier than two (2) calendar days before service is to commence;\nand\niv. For hourly service, no earlier than 1200 APT the day before service is to commence. ATC for the NL Transmission System as posted on the NLSO OASIS is appropriate for use when requesting a reservation for Point-to-Point Transmission Service. \nFollowing receipt of a request for reservation for Point-to-Point Transmission Service, the NLSO will confirm the ATC and inform the Transmission Customer as to the status of its reservation request as soon as reasonably practicable and no later than two hours prior to the scheduling confirmation deadlines set forth in Section 11.2.\nTransmission Customers are required to make any reservations for related Transmission Service they will require in external Control Areas.\n\n11.2 Scheduling of Point-to-Point Transmission Service\nSchedules for Firm or Conditional Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service must be submitted to the NLSO no later than 1100 APT of the day prior to commencement of such service. Schedules for Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service must be submitted to the NLSO no later than 1400 APT of the day prior to commencement of such service. Following receipt of the requested schedule for Point-to-Point Transmission Service, the NLSO will confirm the ATC as soon as reasonably practicable but not later than the following time periods for the following terms of service:\ni. For monthly service: two (2) calendar days;\nii. For weekly service: four (4) hours;\niii. For daily service: thirty (30) minutes; and\niv. For hourly service: thirty (30) minutes.\n\nScheduling changes will be permitted up to thirty (30) minutes before the start of the next scheduling hour provided that the Delivering Party and Receiving Party also agree to the schedule modification. For wheel-in, wheel-out and wheel-through schedules, the NLSO will furnish to the appropriate external Control Area operator, hour-to-hour schedules equal to those furnished by the Receiving Party (unless reduced for losses) and shall deliver the Capacity and Energy provided by such schedules. Should the Transmission Customer, Delivering Party or Receiving Party revise or terminate any schedule, such party shall immediately notify the NLSO, and the NLSO shall have the right to adjust accordingly the schedule for Capacity and Energy to be received and to be delivered.\nAs specified in Section 12.7, Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service is subject to Interruption in specified circumstances, even where that service has already been scheduled.\n\n11.3 Network Integration Transmission Service\nNo later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to commencement of Network Integration Transmission Service and thereafter, on an annual basis, the Network Customer shall:\n(a) Confirm the designation of all Network Loads and Network Resources to be integrated into the provision of Network Integration Transmission Service;\n(b) Provide its best estimate of the total Loads to be served, and the Loads to be served from each NL terminal station; and\n(c) Submit an annual forecast of the maximum summer and winter Load and resource requirements.\nNo later than 1100 APT of the day prior to real-time dispatch, the Network Customer shall provide any necessary day-ahead and real-time Load information for purposes of the appropriate dispatch of Energy and Ancillary Services necessary to meet Network Load.\n\n12.0 Curtailment, Redispatch, Interruptions, Suspension for Reliability and Load Shedding\n12.1 Curtailment Procedures\nThe NLSO shall implement Curtailment of Transmission Service where necessary to respond to contingencies within the NL Control Area and on systems directly and indirectly interconnected with NL Transmission System. Where required, Curtailments will be made on the basis of priority set forth in Section 12.2. The NLSO will ensure that the Transmission Customers are provided with advance notice of any Curtailment, where such notice can be provided consistent with Good Utility Practice and these NL Transmission Policies and Procedures. The NLSO shall only institute Curtailment procedures when the NLSO determines that a system contingency exists, as further addressed in Sections 12.2 and 12.4 and such procedures are necessary to alleviate such contingency.\n\n12.2 Curtailment Priorities\nThe NLSO reserves the right to Curtail, in whole or in part, Transmission Service provided when an emergency or other unforeseen condition threatens to impair or degrade the Reliability of the NL Control Area or the neighbouring Control Areas directly interconnected with the NL Transmission System. To the extent that Transmission Service is curtailed, the NLSO will not apply any credit to a Transmission Customer’s bill for charges otherwise applied. NL Transmission System Conditions: In the event that a Curtailment of Transmission Service over the NL Transmission System is required for conditions occurring within the NL Control Area, such Curtailment shall be carried out in the following priority, up to the level required to effectively relieve the identified constraint:\ni. First, Curtailment of any Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service reservation on the basis of duration of the reservation (e.g., hourly non-firm transactions will be curtailed before daily non-firm transactions and daily non-firm transactions will be curtailed before weekly non-firm transactions) and, as between Transmission Customers holding the same duration of Non-Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service reservations, on a pro rata, non-discriminatory basis;\nii. Thereafter, if required and where pre-specified curtailment conditions exist, curtailment of any Conditional Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service Reservation and as between customers holding the same duration of Conditional Firm Point-toPoint Transmission Service reservations, on a pro rata, non-discriminatory basis; and\niii. Thereafter, if required, Curtailment will be made on a pro rata, non-discriminatory basis to the Network Integration Transmission Service Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service, and, where pre-specified curtailment conditions do not exist, Conditional Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service transaction(s) that most effectively relieve the constraint, consistent with the NL Reliability Standards. External Control Area Conditions: In the event that the NLSO is notified of an emergency or other unforeseen condition that exists in a neighbouring Control Area that requires Curtailment of deliveries over the NL Transmission System, schedules for Transmission Service over the NL Transmission System shall be curtailed consistent with the Curtailment of deliveries required by the applicable external Control Area operator. ```\n\nYou must use obey the following rules:\n1.
